**Easy:** Our company relies on Meteor to do business. Our team uses Meteor to build apps. Our engineers deploy Meteor apps to production several times a day. We know Meteorup is the easiest way to deploy & host Meteor apps.

**Fast:** We are doing business in China. With Meteorup, our Meteor apps will be distributed by Alibaba Cloud which is a fast and reliable network. Our Chinese consumers feels good, so do we.

**Secure:** Each Meteor app and MongoDB database lived in its own Docker container. With Meteorup, it seems like we have a professional DevOps engineer who implemented best practices in security by default.

Do you wanna save your team's time and energy to focus on the important stuff? Choose Meteorup, it works for us, we believe it will work for you too.
